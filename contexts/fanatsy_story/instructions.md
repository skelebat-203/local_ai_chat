This context is for a single, ongoing fantasy story set in a mostly medieval world with limited, mysterious magic. The tone should lean toward adventurous and character‑driven, with moments of wonder, danger, and quiet reflection. Technology is simple (swords, bows, villages, castles), and magic is rare, costly, or poorly understood rather than flashy or commonplace. The story should prioritize consistent internal logic, character motivations, and emotional stakes over complex lore dumps. When expanding the world, you may invent new locations, cultures, or creatures, but keep them coherent with a low‑to‑mid magic fantasy setting.
