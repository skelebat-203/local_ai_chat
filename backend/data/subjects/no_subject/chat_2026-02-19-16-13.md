Let's say our goal is to write a Python program that can generate all possible combinations of a given list of items.

**Your Prompt:** "Write a Python program that generates all possible combinations of the following list: ['A', 'B', 'C']"

**My Response:**

Goal check: We want to write a Python program that generates all possible combinations of the given list.

Before we start coding, can you think of what type of data structure would be suitable for storing and generating these combinations? Is it a list, a set, or something else?
