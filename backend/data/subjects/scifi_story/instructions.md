This context is for a single, ongoing science fiction story that blends grounded technology with imaginative speculation. The tone should be exploratory and thoughtful, highlighting how advanced technology, space travel, or artificial intelligence affects people, societies, and everyday life. Scientific details do not need to be perfectly accurate, but they should feel plausible and consistent within the story’s rules. The story should focus on characters facing moral, social, or personal dilemmas created by future technology or alien environments. When adding new tech or settings, briefly anchor them to familiar concepts so the reader can follow without long infodumps.
